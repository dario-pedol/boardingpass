boardingpass
============

Supposed to be a library to read and write boarding passes. Maybe later an App or so - for now it's just for fun.

Tests are barely even there, example boarding passes are not commited as they have my info in them. I will finde new ones to use.

I wrote this in a few hours, don't use it.
